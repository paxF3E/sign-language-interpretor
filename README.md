# Sign-Language-Translator

The Sign Language Translator is our final project for the **FrostHack Hackathon** https://www.frosthack.com/ . Its purpose is to allow users to communicate more effectively with their computers and other people. To be specific, using this program, you can sign multiple words with one gesture and copy the translated text with the click of a button, talk using gestures that get converted into Computer Speech.
